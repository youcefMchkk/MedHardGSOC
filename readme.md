# Medium-Hard test result

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## the task

-   Medium: set up a GitHub repo with a new R package; use r-lib/actions
    to automatically check the package after every commit; play with the
    GitHub action so that some test functions are run.
-   Hard: implement Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm with C++ with an Rcpp interface
    in your package. Run the test on the Wiki page.
